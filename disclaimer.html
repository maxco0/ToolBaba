        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Tool Baba. Before you begin using our platform and the various utilities, converters, and digital tools we offer, it is essential that you understand the terms, limitations, and nature of our service. This Disclaimer page is not just a formality; it is a transparent explanation of what we provide, how our technology works, and the boundaries of our responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                By accessing Tool Baba, navigating our website, or utilizing any of our online tools, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the stipulations outlined in this document. Our primary goal is to provide helpful, accessible, and free tools to the internet community. However, as with any digital service, there are inherent risks and limitations that users must be aware of.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>General Information Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The content, tools, and information provided on Tool Baba are for general informational and educational purposes only. We strive to create utilities that assist users in daily digital tasks—whether that is formatting code, converting file types, or calculating data. However, this website is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we make every reasonable effort to ensure that the tools function correctly and the information presented is accurate, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability with respect to the website or the information, products, services, or related graphics contained on the website for any purpose. Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>No Professional Advice Clause</h2>
            <p>
                It is crucial to understand that Tool Baba is a technology platform, not a professional service firm. The results generated by our tools do not constitute professional advice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Tools:</strong> Any calculators related to finance, tax, or loans are for estimation purposes only and should not replace the advice of a certified accountant or financial advisor.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal or Compliance Tools:</strong> Any text generation or formatting tools should not be viewed as legal counsel.</li>
                <li><strong>Health or Fitness Tools:</strong> Any data related to BMI or health metrics is for general reference and is not a medical diagnosis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Always consult with a qualified professional in the specific field before making decisions based on data generated by automated online tools.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Accuracy of Information and Tool Outputs</h2>
            <p>
                Technology is constantly evolving, and software can occasionally behave in unexpected ways. While we rigorously test our tools, Tool Baba cannot guarantee that every calculation, conversion, or format change will be 100% accurate at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discrepancies can occur due to various factors, including browser versions, operating system differences, character encoding issues, or unforeseen edge cases in the data you input. We strongly advise users to verify critical data. If you are using a tool to convert a file for a professional presentation or calculating figures for a business report, please double-check the results. Tool Baba assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions in the contents of the service or the outputs generated.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Use of Online Tools and "As Is" Basis</h2>
            <p>
                All tools provided on this website are free to use, but they come without any warranty. We expressly disclaim all warranties, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not warrant that the functions contained in the website will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that this website or the server that makes it available are free of viruses or other harmful components. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>File Handling and User Responsibility</h2>
            <p>
                We take user privacy and data security seriously. However, the nature of online file processing requires user vigilance.
            </p>
            <h3>Client-Side Processing</h3>
            <p>
                Many of our tools are designed to work purely within your web browser (Client-Side). This means that for many operations, your data does not leave your computer and is not uploaded to our servers. We aim for this architecture to maximize privacy. However, users should not assume this applies to every single tool unless explicitly stated.
            </p>
            <h3>User Responsibility</h3>
            <p>
                You are solely responsible for the files you upload or paste into Tool Baba. You agree not to upload content that is illegal, infringes on copyright, contains malware, or violates the rights of others. Tool Baba is a processor of data, not a creator or a storage facility. We do not retain copies of your files for backup purposes. Once you close the tab, your processed data is generally gone from our immediate view. Always keep a backup of your original files.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Browser-Based Processing Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                Because Tool Baba prioritizes speed and privacy by utilizing browser-based technology, the performance of the tools depends heavily on your own device.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are trying to process extremely large files or perform complex calculations on an older device, your browser may freeze or crash. This is a technical limitation of web browsers, not necessarily a bug in our website. We are not responsible for any browser crashes, data loss due to a frozen tab, or system slowdowns experienced while using our resource-intensive tools.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <div class="notice-box">

            <p>
                By using Tool Baba, you are acknowledging that you are using these utilities at your own free will and risk. We built these tools to be helpful assistants, but they are not infallible. Please use common sense, double-check important results, and keep your data backed up.

            <p>
                If you find an error in any of our tools, we welcome feedback so we can improve the experience for everyone, but this does not create a liability on our part to fix it within a specific timeframe.
