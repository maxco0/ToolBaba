        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="meta-info">Last Updated: January 2026</div>

        <article>
            <p>Welcome to Tool Baba. We know that "Privacy Policy" is usually the page people skip, but we genuinely want you to read this one. Why? Because we take a very different approach to data than most other websites on the internet. We built this platform with a "privacy-first" mindset.</p>

            <p>At Tool Baba, our main goal is to provide helpful, fast, and free online tools. We are not in the business of harvesting personal data, selling email lists, or spying on your files. This document explains exactly how our website works, what little data is involved in running a website, and why you can feel safe using our converters, calculators, and utilities.</p>

            <p>By using Tool Baba, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use our website.</p>

            <h2>1. Our Core Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
            <p>Privacy is not just a legal requirement for us; it is the foundation of our architecture. We understand that you might be using our tools to compress personal photos, format sensitive code, or convert important documents. You need to know that these files are safe.</p>
            
            <p>We are committed to being transparent. We do not ask you to create an account, we do not ask for your phone number, and we do not require you to sign in to use our features. The internet is already full of barriers; we don't want to be another one.</p>

            <h2>2. How Our Tools Work (Browser-Based Processing)</h2>
            <div class="security-box">
                <p><strong>The Most Important Thing You Need to Know:</strong><br>
                The vast majority of tools on Tool Baba operate entirely inside your web browser. This is often called "Client-Side Processing."</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>In the past, online tools worked by uploading your file to a server, processing it there, and then sending it back to you. That requires trust that the server won't keep your file. We do it differently.</p>

            <p>When you use our image compressors, text converters, or data formatters, our server sends the instructions (software code) to your device. Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) then executes that code right there on your computer or phone. This means your files <strong>never leave your device</strong> during the processing stage for these tools.</p>

            <p>Because the file stays on your machine, we physically cannot see it, store it, or share it. It remains in your control at all times.</p>

            <h2>3. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <p>To be absolutely clear, here is a list of things we do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Identification:</strong> We do not collect your name, physical address, email address, or phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>User Files:</strong> We do not store the images, documents, or text you process through our tools. Once you close the tab, that data is gone from the browser memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Since our tools are free, we never ask for credit card numbers or banking details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Information We Automatically Collect (Log Data)</h2>
            <p>Like almost every other website on the internet, our hosting server automatically creates "Log Files" when you visit. This is a standard technical requirement to keep the website running and to protect against cyber attacks.</p>
            
            <p>These server logs may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> To detect where traffic is coming from and block malicious bots.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Type and Version:</strong> To help us ensure our tools work correctly on your specific software.</li>
                <li><strong>Time and Date:</strong> To track when our traffic peaks so we can manage server resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Referring Page:</strong> To see how you found us (e.g., via a Google search or a link from another site).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is non-identifying in nature. We use it solely for administrative purposes, debugging errors, and analyzing broad demographic trends (like "20% of our users visit from mobile devices") to improve the user experience.</p>

            <h2>5. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
            <p>We use "Cookies" and "Local Storage" to improve your experience. A cookie is a tiny text file placed on your device. Local Storage is a modern equivalent that allows your browser to remember settings.</p>

            <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
            <p>We use these to remember your preferences. For example, if we introduce a "Dark Mode" and you switch it on, we save a tiny setting in your browser so that the next time you visit, the site remains in Dark Mode. These cookies are essential for the site to feel smooth and user-friendly.</p>

            <h3>Google AdSense and Advertising Cookies</h3>
            <p>To keep Tool Baba completely free, we display advertisements provided by Google AdSense. We do not control the specific content of these ads, but Google uses cookies to make them relevant to you.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DoubleClick DART Cookie:</strong> Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on Tool Baba.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can choose to opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and Content Network Privacy Policy. We strive to work only with reputable advertising partners who respect user privacy standards.</p>

            <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Aside from Google AdSense, we may use trusted third-party services to help us run the site. These services may collect anonymous data to help them function.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We may use Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact with the site. This tells us which tools are the most popular and which ones need fixing. Google Analytics collects data anonymously; it does not tell us who you are personally.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these third-party providers has their own Privacy Policy, and we encourage you to review them if you have concerns about how they handle data.</p>

            <h2>7. Data Security Measures</h2>
            <p>Security is a top priority for us. Even though we don't collect sensitive personal data, we treat your connection with the highest level of security.</p>
            
            <div class="trust-box">
                <p><strong>Secure Connection (SSL/HTTPS):</strong><br>
                Tool Baba is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. You can verify this by looking for the "lock" icon in your browser's address bar. This ensures that the communication between your device and our website is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by hackers.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Furthermore, because our tools run client-side (in your browser), there is no database of user files to be hacked. We have minimized the risk by simply not holding the data in the first place.</p>

            <h2>8. External Links Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Occasionally, we might link to other helpful websites or resources. Please be aware that once you click a link and leave Tool Baba, we have no control over that other website. We are not responsible for the protection and privacy of any information you provide whilst visiting such sites. Always look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>

            <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. Tool Baba is a general audience site and is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>

            <h2>10. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA Reference)</h2>
            <p>Depending on where you live, you have specific rights regarding your data. While we process very little personal data, we respect your rights under frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
            
            <p>Generally, you have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> Know what data is being collected (which we have outlined in this policy).</li>
                <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Fix errors in your data (though we don't hold user profiles to correct).</li>
                <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> Request deletion of data (you can clear your own cookies/cache to remove local data).</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt-out of personalized advertising via Google’s Ad Settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>11. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>The internet evolves, regulations change, and our website grows. Consequently, we may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.</p>
            <p>We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the website after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide by and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>We believe that privacy policies should be a dialogue, not a monologue. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
            
            <p>You can contact our administration team via the contact form found on our homepage. We aim to respond to all privacy-related inquiries promptly.</p>
