        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <div class="subtitle">Effective Date: October 2023 | Last Updated: January 2026</div>

        <article>
            <p>Welcome to Tool Baba. We are delighted to have you use our platform. We know that legal documents can be tedious to read, but they are essential to ensure a safe, reliable, and transparent environment for everyone. These Terms and Conditions outline the rules, obligations, and rights regarding your use of the Tool Baba website and the suite of free digital tools we provide.</p>
            
            <p>By accessing this website, utilizing our converters, calculators, or any other utilities, you are entering into a binding agreement with us. We have done our best to write these terms in plain, understandable English rather than confusing legal jargon, so please take a moment to read them carefully.</p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>Your access to and use of Tool Baba is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
            <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service. Essentially, if you use our tools, you are telling us that you have read, understood, and agreed to these rules.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Tool Baba Services</h2>
            <p>Tool Baba provides a variety of web-based utilities designed to assist with daily digital tasks, such as file format conversion, text manipulation, mathematical calculations, and data formatting. These services are provided free of charge for your personal and commercial use, subject to the limitations set forth in this document.</p>
            
            <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use our tools strictly in accordance with these Terms. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of our services at any time without prior notice. We are constantly improving our algorithms and interface, which means the site may change from time to time.</p>

            <h2>3. Eligibility and User Responsibility</h2>
            <p>To use our website, you must be at least 13 years of age or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction. By using Tool Baba, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.</p>
            <p>As a user, you are fully responsible for how you use our tools. You agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will not use our services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms.</li>
                <li>You will not use the tools to generate, convert, or manipulate content that is offensive, harmful, infringing on intellectual property, or violates the privacy of others.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own device and internet connection while accessing our site.</li>
                <li>You will not attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in our system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Free Tools and "As Is" Clause</h2>
            <div class="callout">
                <p><strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> All tools provided on Tool Baba are free of charge. Consequently, they are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis.</p>
            </div>
            <p>While we strive for perfection and rigorously test our tools to ensuring accuracy, we cannot guarantee that every conversion, calculation, or operation will be 100% error-free. Software, by its nature, can have bugs or unexpected behaviors depending on the user's device, browser version, or input data.</p>
            <p>We do not warrant that the results obtained from the use of the tools will be accurate or reliable for critical, high-stakes, or professional purposes. For example, if you are using a financial calculator on our site, you should verify the results with a professional before making investment decisions. We are not responsible for errors in conversion or data processing.</p>

            <h2>5. Privacy and File Handling (Browser-Based Processing)</h2>
            <p>We understand that data privacy is a massive concern in the digital age. We want to be very clear about how Tool Baba handles your files and data.</p>
            
            <h3>Client-Side Processing</h3>
            <p>The vast majority of tools on Tool Baba function entirely within your web browser (Client-Side). This means that when you select a file to "upload" for conversion or processing, the file does not actually travel to our servers. Instead, the processing logic (JavaScript) runs directly on your device.</p>
            
            <p>Because the processing happens locally on your computer or phone:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not see your files.</li>
                <li>We do not store your files.</li>
                <li>Your sensitive data never leaves your device.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Server-Side Processing (Exceptions)</h3>
            <p>In rare cases where a tool requires heavy computational power that a browser cannot handle, a file may need to be sent to a temporary server for processing. In such specific instances, the file is processed strictly for the purpose of the tool and is deleted automatically immediately after the process is complete. We do not retain, view, or sell user files.</p>

            <h2>6. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>There are two sides to intellectual property on this site: the content you bring, and the content we provide.</p>

            <h3>Your Content</h3>
            <p>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your data, files, and inputs remain yours. When you use a tool to convert an image or format text, the resulting output belongs to you.</p>

            <h3>Our Content</h3>
            <p>The Tool Baba website itself—including its logo, visual design, user interface, underlying code, text content, and custom scripts—is the intellectual property of Tool Baba. You may not copy, reproduce, republish, or distribute our website's code or content without our express written permission. You strictly cannot "scrape" our tools to replicate our functionality on another website.</p>

            <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
            <p>To keep this website available and fast for everyone, specific actions are strictly prohibited. Engaging in these activities may result in your IP address being blocked from accessing our services.</p>
            <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Usage:</strong> Use bots, spiders, scrapers, or scripts to access the website or use the tools automatically. Our tools are for human users only.</li>
                <li><strong>Overloading the System:</strong> Intentionally flood our servers with requests (DDoS attacks) or upload massive files intended to crash the browser or server.</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse Engineering:</strong> Decompile, reverse engineer, or attempt to derive the source code of our tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Malicious Content:</strong> Upload files containing viruses, malware, trojan horses, or any other code designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Framing:</strong> Frame or mirror any part of the Service on any other website without prior authorization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Tool Baba, its owners, developers, affiliates, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>
            <p>This includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</li>
                <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service.</li>
                <li>Any content obtained from the Service.</li>
                <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you use an image compressor and the result isn't what you expected, or if you use a code formatter and it breaks your code, we are not liable for any resulting damages. You use these tools at your own risk.</p>

            <h2>9. External Links and Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Tool Baba. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that Tool Baba shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

            <h2>10. Advertisement Policy</h2>
            <p>To keep Tool Baba free for everyone, we display advertisements provided by third-party networks (such as Google AdSense). These advertisers may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website or other websites.</p>
            <p>While we try to ensure ads are safe and relevant, we do not have direct control over the specific content of every advertisement shown. The inclusion of an ad does not imply an endorsement of the product or service being advertised. If you interact with an advertisement, you are dealing with the third-party advertiser, not Tool Baba.</p>

            <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
            <p>The digital world changes fast, and so do we. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. We encourage you to check this page periodically to stay informed about your rights and responsibilities.</p>

            <h2>12. Termination of Access</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease.</p>
            <p>If you wish to terminate your account (if applicable) or simply stop using the service, you may simply discontinue using the Service. All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

            <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the website owners operate, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

            <h2>14. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>We believe in open communication. If you have any questions, concerns, or clarifications regarding these Terms and Conditions, please do not hesitate to contact us. While we cannot provide legal advice, we are happy to clarify how our tools operate and how these terms apply to your usage.</p>
